Once upon a time there was a man named Frank. He was a student in computer science at UW Madison.
He was from Canada and enjoyed drinking maple syrup and snowboarding. His life was a lot more interesting
than you might think.

For example, Frank used his knowledge in computer sciences to write software that was used all around the world. He then got to travel and present his software at large conferences where he got to meet new people who were just like him. Together they developed new ideas for how to use software to improve the world around them.

Frank was frankly very fond of the story Frankestein too! Amazed by the ideas of what technology can do he created yet another frankestian robot of his own, named Frankie. Frankie who now was Frank's robot frankly loved to be frankamazingly good at every franking thing. What a frankadoodly frank chap aka 'frap'. Frank went places in his life. Unfortunately the last one was the bathroom wher he slipped and now is frankishly lyuing in his bed. What a sad day :(
